# ROS2-KITTI-Preprocessing
This repository contains scripts for pre-processing and visualising pointcloud data coming in from ROS2 topics, along with a script to sparsify KITTI dataset pointclouds, converting LiDAR pointclouds from higher end LiDARs such as the Velodyne HDL-64 to sparser pointclouds representing lower end LiDARs (e.g. A VLP-16).

(I'll hopefully soon get the time to write out a detailed explanation of the contents of these scripts and include acknowlegments for snippets borrowed from other projects.)
